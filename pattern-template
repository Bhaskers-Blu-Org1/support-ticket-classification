# Summary

In this Code Pattern, we will build an app that classifies various consumer complaint support tickets. We'll be using IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier (NLC) to train a model using consumer complaint dataset. Please note that this data is free to use for non-commercial use, and explicit permission must be obtained otherwise. The custom NLC model can be quickly and easily built in the Web UI, deployed into our NodeJS app using the Watson Developer Cloud Nodejs SDK, and then run from a browser.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Build a Watson Natural Language Classifier model using the Web UI.
* Create a Node js app that utilizes the NLC model to classify the collection of consumer complaint support ticket text into various categories.
* Use the Watson Developer Cloud SDK for NodeJS.

# Description

Consumer Finance Protection Bureau receive each week thousands of consumers’ complaints about financial products and services which are sent to various companies for response. With the huge volume of complaints being sent to the companies, it would be practically difficult to go through each and every complaint manually and then categorize the complaint into appropriate categories by various companies. The response time from the right team would take at least 15 days for the proper resolution. This manual approach is total waste of time is an inefficient way of routing the complaints manually.
Because we know about support ticket and have support ticket examples, we can use AI tools to help us determine the nature of support ticket content. IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier (NLC) is a perfect fit for this use case. By providing the training data, we give the NLC service all that is needed to determine which support ticket belong to which category. The convenient uploading of complaints in an csv format in the GUI makes creating the model simple. Then, you can use Watson Developer Cloud SDKs to integrate the service into your application
This categorization of the data help to identify trends and problems in the marketplace to help the companies do a better job supervising companies, enforcing federal consumer financial laws and writing rules and regulations.

# Flow

![](https://github.com/IBM/support-ticket-classification/blob/master/docs/images/architecture.png)

1. User interacts with Natural Language Classifier (NLC) GUI to train the model.
2. [Consumer complaint support ticket Dataset](https://github.ibm.com/riyamaro/support-ticket-classification/tree/master/docs/training_data) is loaded to the NLC service for training.
3. User uploads excel file(having .xlsx extension) with test data to have it classified.
4. App uses Watson Natural Language Classifier to classify the collection to mortgage, banking, loans or credit card related support tickets.
