"I had recently received a check for a settlement. The check was a Capital One check. I had deposited this check in an ATM, and then followed up with Capital One that same night about when the funds would be available. The agent on the phone said that as it is a Capital One check that {$1000.00} would be immediately available, and then more amounts would become available as it was a rather large check. The agent had assured me that the {$1000.00} funds were available. The next morning I checked my account on the mobile app and Capital One had it showing that the full amount of the deposit was available. I then went spending as if that money was available. A few days later I went to buy some food and my card was declined. I called Capital One and they informed me that my account had been overdrafted and that the check I had deposited was put on "" security '' and that is was my fault for not checking the balance each time I spent money, I went through   managers and they all refused to understand my point of view.
